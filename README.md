10gig-fox-shield
================
This project has example firmware for a 10 GHz fox hunt transmitter.

For the San Diego Maker Faire 2015, Kerry Banke, N6IZW, and Drew Arnett,
KB9FKO, from the San Diego Microwave Group put together a 10 GHz fox hunt.
Kerry build a simple, directional AM receiver based on an inexpensive
satellite TV LNB and an AD8307.  Drew built a simple AM transmitter with an
Arduino UNO, a custom shield, and an inexpensive 10 GHz DRO motion detector
module.

Writing firmware for the fox transmitter was remarkably simple with the
Arduino IDE.  The firmware in this project is provided for education.

The example programs are:

1:  a barebones application, was used for initial hardware testing.

2:  was used to test out AM.

3:  added letter beacon modes.  This was used at the Maker Faire.

4:  added key input, and was used to make an easy two-way contact over a five
mile distance shortly after the Maker Faire.

Best regards,
