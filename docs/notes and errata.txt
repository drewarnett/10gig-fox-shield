Overall Assembly
----------------
In addition to the shield, the following parts were used to complete the
assembly for the Maker Faire:

1 8xAA battery pack
	Digikey part number BK-030-ND
	MPD (Memory Protection Devices)	part number BK-030
1 10.525 GHz DRO motion detector module
4 2 pin headers
1 OSEPP Uno R3 Plus (Arduino R3 compatible)

Any Arduino Uno R3 compatible would work.  The OSEPP is nice because of the
low profile USB jack that it uses.

2 pin headers are soldered into the DRO module.  Friction is sufficient to hold the DRO module on the shield and the shield on the Arduino.

The DRO module has a tuning slug that can be used to bring it down
into the 10.0 to 10.5 GHz amateur radio band.


Schematic Errata
----------------
Tip and shield connections are swapped on the key jack.
